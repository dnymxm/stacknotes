                <h2>What is Stacknotes?</h2>
                <p> Stacknotes was created in spite of wasting so much time searching for trivial
                    things I knew I had done before. I often found myself looking through previous projects or
                    tracking
                    down articles for that code snippet I knew existed. I thought there had to be a better way...
